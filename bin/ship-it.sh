## Disable OverCommit-managed Git Hooks (https://github.com/sds/overcommit).
## 1. We don't want to slow down (or worse, break!) the merge process with
##    repeated RuboCop (and other) checks.
## 2. The merge commit subject lines can often get pretty long
##    ("Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/â€¦' into predeploy_master"
##     is 60 chars + the branch name).
##    I want to enforce TextWidth on _regular_ commits but SKIP it here.
